# RPG App

This is the front end for my RPG app. The app helps players create characteres for their games.

## Tech Used

- Vite
- Auth0

To set up the app you will need to create a .env.local file with the following:
VITE_AUTHO_DOMAIN=
VITE_AUTHO_CLIENT_ID=

The values for these can be found inside the Auth0 account: https://manage.auth0.com/
